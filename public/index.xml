      <description>The address for the location is: Kampeerboerderij &amp;ldquo;de Arendshorst&amp;rdquo; Arendhorsterweg 1 7731 RC Ommen Check openstreetmap or google maps
GPS : 52.52563546413736, 6.36783499278495
By Car Get on the N340 from Zwolle to Ommen, and exit at this crossing. You will be driving towards the camera in this viewpoint. Then follow the &amp;ldquo;Hessenweg&amp;rdquo; towards Ommen for a few hundred meters until you see this crossing. The lack of pavement on the left is why you want to exit the N340 a bit earlier and the sign for &amp;ldquo;Kampeerboerderij de Arendshorst&amp;rdquo; correctly points to the right.</description>
