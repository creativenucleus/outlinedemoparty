# COMPETITIONS
Outline is an Atari party at heart, but all platforms are welcome to strut their stuff.
These are the compo's from 2023, still may be changing for 2024!

## Deadline

Deadline for all compos is on TBD

Acceptance of any prods after this deadline cannot be guaranteed and could only in theory be considered if the prod is delivered along with a 1280x720 video recording that works in VLC.


### Please send a video capture along with your entry, or a Dropbox (etc) link where we can grab the capture

The aspect ratio of your file should be exactly 16:9, you are welcome to use padding to achieve this aspect ratio

We will show your entry in 1280x720 at 60fps using OBS' built-in scaling filter

We will show your entry scaled up to 1920x1080 at it's original framerate at the partyplace if it's a framerate our beamer supports (50hz is possible)

Raw capture of the prod only (except in Wild compo)

Do not manipulate your recording for performance

We reserve the right to disqualify recordings that do not realistically represent how its executable demo or intro counterpart runs on real hardware.
Examples of editing actions that could lead to disqualification:

Unrealistic emulator settings during recording, sped up recordings, removing or cutting down precalculation or loading screens.
Examples of editing actions that are encouraged:

Cutting footage before the prod is launched, cutting footage after the prod ends, loops or becomes repetitive, scaling and padding your recording to 1920x1080 or 1280x720.
Multiple entries per compo are allowed

You are welcome to send more than one entry for a compo.
We will use Wuhu as partysystem

Soon a link to our partysystem will appear here. You will be able to submit your entry in our partysystem, also as remote competitor.

### Think we should add a compo?

If we get a suggestion for a compo and entries from at least 3 participants we'll be happy to discuss further details about the compo with you.


## General rules

Outline has traditionally offered a wide variety of competitions, in 2023 we have limited the line-up to demo, 128 byte intro, 256 byte intro, music, graphics, photo and animation (some of these with subcategories). All these competitions are multi-platform.

* Don't be an idiot. Don't break any Dutch laws, respect copyright law and don't cheat.
* Anyone is allowed to participate in our compos, also remotely. Please send your entries to compos@outlinedemoparty.nl (online upload will be announced later). Supply all relevant details regarding platform, format, etc. Optionally, you may supply a description to be shown before your entry is played.* * Only previously unreleased work may be entered into the competitions.
* Competitions can be merged, split, or cancelled at the compo team's discretion. However, we will try to seek agreement from the involved creators if feasible. Rule of thumb is that at least three entries are required for a compo to be held.
* Technical details, formats and platforms for entries will be announced before screening.
* Please supply a link to a video capture for any real-time entries - regardless of platform. If you're unable to provide one, please let us know beforehand. Similarly, participants in the music competition are requested to supply MP3 or OGG renditions in case of non-modern or uncommon formats.
* The compo team reserves the right to apply preselection in case of large numbers of entries, or to filter out troll/low-effort entries. Entries not shown in the competitions will not be released by Outline.* The compo team has the final word on things. We are reasonable people though, so we will do our best to be of help!
* The maximum size for entry uploads to our partysystem is 1Gb.* If you wish to submit a larger file, please upload it elsewhere and upload the link in a text file or the comments on our partysystem.
* The submission deadline for all entries is Thursday evening, May 18th, at midnight (CEST).
