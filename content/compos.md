# COMPETITIONS
Outline is an Atari party at heart, but all platforms are welcome to strut their stuff.

## Deadline for all compo entries is May 8th 2024, at midnight (CEST)

Acceptance of any prods after this deadline cannot be guaranteed and could only in theory be considered if the prod is delivered along with a 1280x720 video recording that works in VLC.

Soon a link to our partysystem will appear here. You will be able to submit your entry in our partysystem, also as remote competitor. For remote participation you don't need to buy a ticket.

You can send your remote entry via [wuhu](https://party.outlinedemoparty.nl/)

### Think we should add a compo?

If we get a suggestion for a compo and entries from at least 3 participants we'll be happy to discuss further details about the compo with you.

# General Rules

* Anyone is allowed to participate in our compos and we welcome remote entries which can submitted through [a url that we announce  soonTM]
* Only previously unreleased work may be entered into the competitions.
* Use common sense, don’t break any Dutch laws, respect copyright law and don’t cheat.
* Competitions can be merged, split, or cancelled at the compo team’s discretion. However, we will try to seek agreement from the involved creators if feasible. Rule of thumb is that at least three entries are required for a compo to be held.
* Technical details, formats and platforms for entries will be announced before screening.
* The compo team reserves the right to apply preselection in case of large numbers of entries, or to filter out troll/low-effort entries. Entries not shown in the competitions will not be released by Outline.
* The compo team has the final word on things. We are reasonable people though, so we will do our best to be of help!
* The maximum size for entry uploads to our partysystem is 512MB. If you wish to submit a larger file, please upload it elsewhere and upload the link in a text file or the comments on our partysystem.
