## By Car

Get on the N340 from Zwolle to Ommen, and exit at this crossing. You will be driving towards the camera in this viewpoint.

<br/>
Then follow the "Hessenweg" towards Ommen for a few hundred meters until you see this crossing. The lack of pavement on the left is why you want to exit the N340 a bit earlier and the sign for "Kampeerboerderij de Arendshorst" correctly points to the right.
