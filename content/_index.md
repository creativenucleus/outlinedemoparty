## May 9-12 2024 (Ascension day weekend)

Holland's longest running annual demoscene event offers DJs and live acts, competitions for all platforms, great dinner and beds at location, free breakfast, tea and coffee, live coding sessions and craptastic prize giving ceremonies at Sunday 11:30. 

Outline 2024 is a demo party, an event which takes place over the course of several days. It is a place where people compete, and celebrate the creative use of computers. If this is your first encounter with Outline or demo parties in general, you would do well to read up on the matter on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene).

Outline started in 2004 as a party organised by and for the Atari demo scene to coincide with Breakpoint (one of the largest demo scene events held annually in Germany). Word got out and the unique atmosphere started attracting people from other platforms. Today, Outline remains an Atari party at heart but welcomes all platforms to mingle, agree and disagree.

This year we will have a new main organizer and a new team! Let us introduce to you the core-team for 2024: **Zeno4ever** - Main orga  **Wurstgetrank** - Number Two  **Harekiet** - Compo’s  **Cookie** - Chef bar  **EAT-DRINK-FUCK** - Kitchen chef  **Duckz0rs** - Kitchen chef  **Datucker** - DJ’s  **BEFTEX** - Promo  


# NEWS ABOUT THE PARTY

Remote participation is open! 
Submit your entries for *free* via wuhu. Check out 'COMPOS' for details, rules and login. 
We're looking forward to your creations! 

### Before you travel to the party

To make use of the beds at the facility, you must bring your own sheet and blanket or sleepingbag. Just a blanket or sleepingbag is not enough, the sheet is obligatory for every visitor.

The visitor fridge will not be open until after the party's groceries have been delivered (between 1600 and 1800 on Thursday), sorry. We might not have a lot of space left for visitor stuff in our fridge. 

Park your car in the blue area, park in the yellow area if you have a camper:

<p>

If you have a lot of materials to unload please park in the car park, then come check if there are any other vehicles unloading and which door you want to unload at, and only come driving around the back of the party hall when you have verified that you won't obstruct or drive over any person, animal or materials.

If you come by train please don't call us for pickups (sorry, we'll have no capacity). Use [OV Taxi](https://ov.taxi/) or [OV Fiets](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets) instead.

Having said that- Looking forward to seeing you in Ommen this Ascension day weekend!
