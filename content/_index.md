# OUTLINE 2024

## May 9-12 2024 (Ascension day weekend)

Holland's longest running annual demoscene event offering DJs and live acts, competitions for all platforms, free breakfast, tea and coffee, live coding sessions, and craptastic prize giving ceremonies at sunday 11:30

Outline 2024 is a demo party, an event which takes place over the course of several days. It is a place where people compete, and celebrate the creative use of computers. If this is your first encounter with Outline or demo parties in general, you would do well to read up on the matter on wikipedia.

Outline started in 2004 as a party organised by and for the Atari demo scene to coincide with Breakpoint (one of the largest demo scene events held annually in Germany). Word got out and the unique atmosphere started attracting people from other platforms. Today, Outline remains an Atari party at heart but welcomes all platforms to mingle, agree and disagree.

This year we will have a other main orginiser, (Hi Zeno4ever) so things still have to be put on the rails. For now put the days already in your agenda !


# NEWS ABOUT THE PARTY

Before you travel to the party

To make use of the beds at the facility, you must bring your own sheet and blanket or sleepingbag. Just a blanket or sleepingbag is not enough, the sheet is obligatory for every visitor.

To eat the breakfast, your own food and/or drink your own drinks at Outline you are expected to bring your own plates, bowls, cups, spoons, forks, knives, etc etc. You can not expect to borrow items from the kitchen/bar (havoc refuses to do your dishes, sorry about that). For the catering meals and coffee and tea we'll provide disposable plates, bowls, cutlery and cups.

The visitor fridge will not be open until after the party's groceries have been delivered (between 1600 and 1800 on Thursday), sorry. We might not have a lot of space left for visitor stuff in our fridge.

Park your car in the blue area, park in the yellow area if you have a camper:

If you have a lot of materials to unload please park in the car park, then come check if there are any other vehicles unloading and which door you want to unload at, and only come driving around the back of the party hall when you have verified that you won't obstruct or drive over any person, animal or materials.

If you come by train please don't call us for pickups (sorry, we'll have no capacity). Use https://ov.taxi/ or https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets instead.

Having said that- Looking forward to seeing you in Ommen this Ascension day weekend!

## Our Location

The location for Outline is Kampeerboerderij De Arendshorst in Ommen, The Netherlands.

Sleeping facilities at this location are bunkbeds, similar to our previous locations. In the area around the location you can find a plethora of alternative accomodation options. Sleeping in tents at the facility itself is possible only for a very small amount of 1-person tents and therefore not offered as a booking option at this moment. Sleeping in cars, vans or campervans is possible for no extra fee on the facility's parking lot.
